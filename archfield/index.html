<p><img src="ArchFieldScreenShot.jpg" width="1000" alt="screenShot" /></p>
<p><strong>ArchField C++</strong> is a stand-alone software for recording and managing field excavations and survey in Digital Heritage. It enables real-time digital GIS 3D Top Plan production within a rendering engine designed for visualizing massive 3D datasets. ArchField directly connects to Total Stations and our RTK GPS units to record sub-centimeter measurements for artifacts, scanning markers, loci boundaries, and camera positions. </p>
<p>Archfield C++ is free to use for non-commercial and educational use (see <a href="LICENSE.txt">license</a>). It has been developed at the Visual Computing Center (VCC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia by Dr. Neil Smith (neil.smith@kaust.edu.sa). If you would like to use ArchField in your research or for a publication, please cite our latest paper: </p>

<p class="sections">Installation Guide:</p>
<p>1. Unpack ArchField onto a location on your hardrive. Recommended location is on root drive (e.g. C:\).</p>
<p>2. Launch ArchField.exe from within the ArchField folder</p>
<p>3. You can create a shortcut on desktop by &quot;right clicking&quot; on ArchField.exe and selecting &quot;Sent to-&gt;Desktop (create shortcut)&quot;</p>
<p class="sections">Documentation: </p>
<p>Comming Soon!</p>
<p class="sections">FAQ:</p>
<p>What formats can be loaded into Archfield?</p>
<p>-ArchField can load OBJ, PTS, PLY (Binary and Ascii), XYZ, XYB. Currently it does not handle well data that has double precision coordinates (e.g. 3750000.353, 753000.121). Use the PLY-&gt;OSGA converter for Pointclouds to remove UTM coordinates. Also if you want your data to be measured it  must be properly scaled (1.0  = 1.0 meter).</p>
<p>What does Save Project do?</p>
<p>-It will save all layers loaded and bookmarks to a .prj file on the harddrive. You can always reload all your data from you create prj file. </p>
<p>How do I use the measure tool?</p>
<p>-Click on the measure button (icon with polyline) from the toolbar. Hold down CRTL and then click on the point you want to measure. Release CTRL if you want to navigate the scene. To reset measurement toggle on and off the measure button.</p>
<p>How do I segment data using Select Tools?</p>
<p>-Select the &quot;Select Tools&quot; tab. Load a pointcloud (currently only supports Pointclouds). Click Activate toggle button. Click on the area you want not start the resizing of the segment box (you can't manipulate the screen before initializing location of the segment box, if you need to navigate, first deactivate the Activate button). Once select box is created, click on Get current pos. You can then move and resize the segment box. When you have the desired area selected, click Extract button. </p>
<p>-The extracted points are not saved to the harddrive. To save right click on the item in the layers view and select Export.</p>
<p>How do I start recording Point and Polygon sets?</p>
<p>-Select either Point or Polygon tabbed window. Enter a date to initialize the file for that day's excavation (you can also enter any name in here but it will not work properly with the field recording database). Newly created points and polygon sets are stored as kml in your project folder.</p>
<p>-For Points: Click Togglle Record. Then navigate to point cloud and select point by holding down CTRL and clicking. You can keep updating selected point if it is not exactly where you want. Once you are satisfied, click Get Coord (this populates the x,y,z field, you can also mainly enter x,y,z coordinate as well). Once the x,y,z field is populated click on Record button.</p>
<p>-For Polygons: Click Togglle Record. Then navigate to point cloud and select first point by holding down CTRL and clicking. You can keep updating selected point if it is not exactly where you want. Once you are satisfied, click Get Coord (this converts the point to green and adds it to the window. Move on to create more vertices in the same way (clicking, hitting get coord). Once you have minimum 3 added vertices click on Record. This will close the polygon from first to the last vertice you entered (make sure last vertices is green and added to window by clicking the Get coord button). </p>
